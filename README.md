# WeatherFlex
Develop a application using React that provides users with real-time and forecasted weather data.
Weather App
Assignment Overview:
This assignment involves building a weather application using React/React Native. The application fetches real-time and forecasted weather data from the Tomorrow.io API and displays it to the users. The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in building a mobile or web application using React/React Native and integrating external APIs.

How to Run the Application:
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Install dependencies using npm install or yarn install.
Start the development server using npm start or yarn start.
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.
Dependencies:
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
Installation Instructions:
To install the necessary dependencies and set up the development environment, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <repository-url>.
Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
Configuration:
No additional configuration is required. However, make sure to replace the API key in the WeatherAPI.js and ForecastAPI.js files with your own Tomorrow.io API key.

Testing:
Currently, there are no specific tests included in the project. However, you can manually test the application by running it locally and verifying that it fetches and displays weather data correctly.

Issues and Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues with running the application, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured correctly.
If you encounter API-related errors, such as "Too Many Requests," check your API key and ensure that you're not exceeding the rate limits.
